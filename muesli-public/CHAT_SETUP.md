# Chat Feature Setup

The chat feature has been successfully implemented! Here's how to set it up:

## Setup Instructions

1. **Get your OpenAI API Key:**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key

2. **Add the API Key to your environment:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `muesli-public` directory
   - Add the following line:
     ```
     OPEN_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Restart the application:**
   - Stop the current instance
   - Run `npm start` again

## Features

- **Chat Interface:** Located in the right sidebar when viewing a note
- **Default Questions:** Quick action buttons for common tasks:
  - List action items
  - Write follow-up email
  - List Q&A
  - Make notes more concise
  - Make notes more detailed
- **Scope Validation:** The AI will only answer questions based on the meeting content and will say "This is beyond the scope of the meeting notes" for unrelated questions
- **Real-time Chat:** Type your own questions in the chat input

## How it Works

- The chat uses the current note content as context
- All responses are based only on the information in the meeting notes
- The AI will politely decline to answer questions not related to the meeting content
- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for fast and cost-effective responses

Enjoy your new chat feature! ðŸŽ‰
